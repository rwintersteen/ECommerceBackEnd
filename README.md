# ECommerceBackEnd

## The Task

Building the back end for an e-commerce site that uses the latest technologies so that a company can compete with other e-commerce companies. Modification of starter code was utilized and working with Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database in order to build the back end portion.

Because this application is not deployed, a link is provided to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the acceptance criteria being met. 

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
